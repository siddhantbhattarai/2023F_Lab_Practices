## **Linux Learning Assignment**

### **Section 1: Directory and File Management**
1. Create the following directory structure using Linux commands:  
   ```
   Linux_Assignment/
   ├── Projects/
   │   ├── Project1/
   │   ├── Project2/
   └── Notes/
       ├── Week1.txt
       ├── Week2.txt
   ```

2. Navigate to `Project2` and create an empty file named `README.md`.

3. Use a command to view all the files (including hidden ones) in the `Linux_Assignment` directory in a detailed list format.

4. Move `Week2.txt` from `Notes/` to `Project1/`.

5. Delete the `README.md` file in `Project2`.

---

### **Section 2: Text Editing and File Content**
1. Create a file named `about_me.txt` in `Notes/` and add the following content using a single command:  
   ```
   Name: Manish
   Learning: Linux
   Goal: Proficient in Linux administration
   ```

2. View the contents of `about_me.txt` using a command.

3. Append the following line to `about_me.txt` using a single command:  
   ```
   Interest: Automation and Security
   ```

4. Use the `vim` editor to replace the word "Learning" with "Mastering" in `about_me.txt`.

5. Count the number of lines, words, and characters in the `about_me.txt` file.

---

### **Section 3: Permissions and Ownership**
1. Change the permissions of the `Projects` directory to allow only the owner to read, write, and execute it.

2. Verify the permissions of the `Projects` directory.

3. Create a new user named `testuser` and change the owner of the `Notes` directory to `testuser`.

4. Switch to `testuser` and try to create a file in the `Projects` directory. Note your observation.

---

### **Section 4: Process Management**
1. Open a terminal and run the `ping` command to continuously ping `google.com`.  
   Stop the process after 10 seconds.

2. Find the process ID (PID) of the `ping` command before stopping it.

3. Start the `ping` command again and send it to the background.

4. Bring the `ping` command back to the foreground and stop it.

---

### **Section 5: Package Management**
1. Install the `tree` package using `apt`.

2. Verify the installation by running the `tree` command in the `Linux_Assignment` directory.

3. Remove the `tree` package using `apt`.

## **Solutions**

### **Section 1: Directory and File Management**
1. Commands:  
   ```bash
   mkdir -p Linux_Assignment/Projects/Project1
   mkdir -p Linux_Assignment/Projects/Project2
   mkdir -p Linux_Assignment/Notes
   touch Linux_Assignment/Notes/Week1.txt
   touch Linux_Assignment/Notes/Week2.txt
   ```

2. Navigate and create file:  
   ```bash
   cd Linux_Assignment/Projects/Project2
   touch README.md
   ```

3. View all files:  
   ```bash
   ls -la Linux_Assignment
   ```

4. Move file:  
   ```bash
   mv Linux_Assignment/Notes/Week2.txt Linux_Assignment/Projects/Project1/
   ```

5. Delete file:  
   ```bash
   rm Linux_Assignment/Projects/Project2/README.md
   ```

---

### **Section 2: Text Editing and File Content**
1. Create file with content:  
   ```bash
   echo -e "Name: Manish\nLearning: Linux\nGoal: Proficient in Linux administration" > Linux_Assignment/Notes/about_me.txt
   ```

2. View contents:  
   ```bash
   cat Linux_Assignment/Notes/about_me.txt
   ```

3. Append line:  
   ```bash
   echo "Interest: Automation and Security" >> Linux_Assignment/Notes/about_me.txt
   ```

4. Edit with Vim:  
   ```bash
   vim Linux_Assignment/Notes/about_me.txt
   ```
   *(Press `i` to enter insert mode, edit text, then save and exit with `Esc :wq`.)*

5. Count lines, words, characters:  
   ```bash
   wc Linux_Assignment/Notes/about_me.txt
   ```

---

### **Section 3: Permissions and Ownership**
1. Change permissions:  
   ```bash
   chmod 700 Linux_Assignment/Projects
   ```

2. Verify permissions:  
   ```bash
   ls -ld Linux_Assignment/Projects
   ```

3. Create a new user and change ownership:  
   ```bash
   sudo useradd testuser
   sudo chown testuser:testuser Linux_Assignment/Notes
   ```

4. Switch to `testuser` and try to create a file:  
   ```bash
   su testuser
   touch Linux_Assignment/Projects/test.txt
   ```
   *(You’ll see a "Permission denied" error.)*

---

### **Section 4: Process Management**
1. Run and stop `ping`:  
   ```bash
   ping google.com
   # Press Ctrl+C after 10 seconds to stop
   ```

2. Find PID:  
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep ping
   ```

3. Send to background:  
   ```bash
   ping google.com &
   ```

4. Bring back to foreground and stop:  
   ```bash
   fg
   # Press Ctrl+C to stop
   ```

---

### **Section 5: Package Management**
1. Install `tree`:  
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install tree
   ```

2. Verify installation:  
   ```bash
   tree Linux_Assignment
   ```

3. Remove `tree`:  
   ```bash
   sudo apt remove tree
   ```
